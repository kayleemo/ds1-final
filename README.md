# Predicting the Mid-Career Salary of Undergraduate Students

## Background
As I am nearing graduation as a upperclassmen in college, I am now more than ever concerned about the return on academic investment given the current economic climate. I wondered exactly what, and if there are any, characteristics of colleges that lead to higher monetary returns after four-years of university. 

I created a regression problem using mid-career salary of graduated undergraduate students as the response variable (continuous). I was interested in creating an inference problem because I wanted to identify the relationship between multiple university predictors –  Baron’s selectivity scale, student/faculty ratio, student population, and average tuition costs – and the resulting return on education (measured here by mid-career salary). For instance, I tried to identify if a university’s average tuition costs impact the students’ mid-career salary.
